    "From there, we can create and modify dataframes with functions from the package. Let’s start by reading in a dataset and doing some basic manipulations. This will also require `numpy` functions, so make sure this package is also installed, like above.\n",

    "Pandas can read in data in many formats – comma-separated (CSV), tab-separated (TSV), Excel, XML, etc. The most common ones you will use are probably CSV and Excel. Make sure you have the most up to date version of `pandas` because the `read_excel` file was added recently."
