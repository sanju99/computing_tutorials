# HMS Computing Bootcamp

This bootcamp is designed to help scientists with little to no computing experience work with large datasets and analyze their own data. It is written predominantly in Python with some mentions of R. It is geared towards biologists at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and provides instructions and resources for using O2, the high performance computing cluster provided by HMS.

The bootcamp is organized into a series of tutorials. These are provided in HTML and iPython notebook files, which contain the same information. The HTML files are static renderings of the iPython notebooks. To see code running and modify your own code for exercises, follow along in the iPython notebooks. 

## Google Colab

One of the easiest ways to run code is through Google Colab. Because it runs on external servers, you don't need to install anything on your laptops (local machines). However, unless you pay for Google Colab, it deletes all your uploaded files every 12 hours. For long-term use, I would work locally or on a high-performance cluster where things can be safely stored.
